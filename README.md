# Cricket Game

Welcome to the Cricket Game, a simple console-based cricket simulation written in Python. This game allows players to compete against the computer in a fun and interactive way.

## Features

- **Toss**: Decide whether to bat or bowl based on the outcome of a coin toss.
- **Scoring**: Select numbers to score runs; the computer's choices are random.
